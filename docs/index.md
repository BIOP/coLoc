# Introduction

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BIOP/coLoc/refs/heads/main/resources/mini_logo.png" title="coLoↄ" width="10%" align="bottom"> is a collaborative board game to teach co-localization analysis, in which the players, a.k.a **The Scientists**, team up against the game master , a.k.a **Reviewer 3**.

# How to play

In a <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BIOP/coLoc/refs/heads/main/resources/mini_logo.png" title="coLoↄ" width="10%" align="bottom"> game **The Scientists** have to prepare an Experiment Plan that will be reviewed by **Reviewer 3**. The Experiment Plan, is made of cards describing the microscope settings, the images settings and finally the analysis workflow. 

You can play <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BIOP/coLoc/refs/heads/main/resources/mini_logo.png" title="coLoↄ" width="10%" align="bottom">  in two different modes:

- Science First
- Time is of the essence.

## Science First

This is the recommended game mode for courses or with new gamers.

In <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BIOP/coLoc/refs/heads/main/resources/mini_logo.png" title="coLoↄ" width="10%" align="bottom"> , **The Scientists** goals(s) are to :

- fulfil all **Reviewer 3**'s demands so The Scientists get a valid experiment
- try to get as few clocks (<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BIOP/coloc/refs/heads/main/resources/misc/clock.png" title="clocks" width="5%" align="bottom">) as possible at the end of the experiment

We'll just stress out one more time, the most important is to have a pleased **Reviewer 3** (and only then try to limit the amount of <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BIOP/coloc/refs/heads/main/resources/misc/clock.png" title="clocks" width="5%" align="bottom">)

## Time is of the essence

The Scientists have a limited amount of <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BIOP/coloc/refs/heads/main/resources/misc/clock.png" title="clocks" width="5%" align="bottom"> at their disposal. The Scientists can only use 20 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BIOP/coloc/refs/heads/main/resources/misc/clock.png" title="clocks" width="5%" align="bottom"> (25 or 30 for decreasing difficulty)
